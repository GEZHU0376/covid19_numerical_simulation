Modeling covid-19 transmission with implicit and explicit Euler's numerical method

Conventional susceptible, infectious, and recovery (SIR) disease model utilize ordinary differential equation to describe the dynamics of disease progression between groups. This approach is called compartmental modeling. We introduce and model the ongoing covid-19 pandemic with modified SIR differential equations. By introducing vital dynamics parameters (death rate and birth rate), we can better model the dynamic of transmission in a fixed population. 

The base SIR model equation:
