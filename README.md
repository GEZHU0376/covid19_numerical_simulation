Modeling covid-19 transmission with implicit and explicit Euler's numerical method

### Description:
Conventional susceptible, infectious, and recovery (SIR) disease model utilize ordinary differential equation to describe the dynamics of disease progression between groups. This approach is called compartmental modeling. We introduce and model the ongoing covid-19 pandemic with modified SIR differential equations. By introducing vital dynamics parameters (death rate and birth rate), we can better model the dynamic of transmission in a fixed population. 

### The base SIR model equation:

### Analytical solution for ODE:

Below are two additional approach in compartmental disease modeling using ODE and numerical methods:

### Introducing vital dynamics into the equation (Birth and death rate):

### Add death rate/fatality into the compartmental model
